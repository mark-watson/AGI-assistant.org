  <h1>AGI Assistant Overview</h1>
  <p>
    Intelligence and knowledge are a form of compression. The AGI
    Assistant uses text as memory. These texts are comprised of
    stored conversations with users, reference texts used to answer
    user's previous queries, and any reference text provided to the AGI
    Assistant.
  </p>
  <p>
    For efficiency all memory texts are both summarized and indexed using
    vector embeddings,
  </p>

  <h1>Standing on the shoulders of giants</h1>
  <p>
    The tools used to build the AGI Assistant are: LangChain, LlamaIndex,
    the OpenAI APIs, and open models from Hugging Face. I have found the
    a academic paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442">Generative
      Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior</a> to be
    inspirational and useful, and also Yohei Nakajim's ideas of Baby AGI.
